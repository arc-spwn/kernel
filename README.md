# rust-kernel
a funny rust kernel that writes `Hello World` to your screen

## requirements
if u have rustup installed you can run `make setup-env` to download all the stuff you need **WARNING: this will set nightly as your default toolchain, if you dont want this, run `rustup default stable` after you compiled the kernel**

## building
just run `make` or `make compile` lol
